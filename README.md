Problem Statement: Lorry Transport Management System
The transportation of goods via lorries is a crucial part of logistics in various industries, including agriculture, construction, and retail. Managing the data related to lorry transport is essential for ensuring efficient operations and accurate financial records. In this context, the Lorry Transport Management System is being developed to handle and streamline the collection, tracking, and reporting of transport data.

Objectives:
->Data Collection: The system allows users (such as transport operators or company staff) to input relevant transport data, including the date, lorry number, and the amount collected for each transport operation.
->Data Insertion and Storage: The system stores the transport data in a MySQL database, ensuring that it is securely saved for future reference, analysis, and reporting.
->Data Querying: The system enables users to query the database in different ways:
->View all transport records.
->Search for records by a specific date.
->Search for records by lorry number.
->Financial Reporting: The system can calculate the total amount collected for a given date or lorry number, allowing for financial analysis and reporting.

User-Friendly Interface: The system provides an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, making it easy for non-technical users to interact with the system and access key functionalities.

Features:
Insert Data: Users can input data such as the transport date, lorry number, and the amount collected.
View Data: Users can view all transport data or filter records based on a date or lorry number.
Financial Calculation: The system can calculate the total amount collected on a particular date or for a particular lorry.
Error Handling: The system ensures that the data is correctly validated before insertion, providing appropriate error messages if required fields are missing or data is invalid.

Challenges:
->Designing an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users.
->Providing accurate financial reports based on user queries.
